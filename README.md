# 16-Bit Computer v0.1 (WIP)
This Computer consists of a 16-Bit CPU with custom instructions and a RAM with 64KB of memory.
512 Bytes are allocated for Instructions, the rest is used for either program memory or the stack memory.

# Architecture type
This processor has a custom type cpu, which is realistically not possible, since this one is just an attempt of understanding how a computer is actually working.

I'll call the architecture:

    x16_v Architecture

The is working in 16 Bit and handles 16 Bit of instructions per tick.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in early development and therefore not done at all. Currently it has been scarcely tested and is made to implement all features first!
